# Design-and-photography-portfolio
This repository contains the source code of a web page design project to display a portfolio of services and products, specifically in graphic design, illustration and photography. I developed this project as final class work for the artist of the illustrations shown on the website.
The project was developed using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and frameworks such as Bootstrap.
Likewise, good practices acquired in the subject of Web Programming are used.
